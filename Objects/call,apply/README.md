<h2>call</h2>
<p>using call method,we can define a function and apply that fucntion on every object.
 parameters: first parameter: the this object(the object we are going to apply the function)
 second-parameter: list of items</p>
<h2>apply</h2>
<p>same as call method, the only difference is here we pass the arguments as an array</p>
<h2>bind</h2>
<p>same as call method, but it does not run instantly, we can assign to a variable and invoke it later</p>
