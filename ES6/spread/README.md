<h2>Spread syntax(...)</h2>
<p>it allows iterables like array or strings to be expanded,so that they can be used later in functions as arguments and in arrays as elements.</p>
<p>we are not referencing to the elements which wooul cause mutating the orginal values,but to copy them.</p>
<p>it splits the items into single single items, if it is a string, that will be splited into letters if it is an array, that will be splitted into elements</p>
<p>One of the main usage of spread operator changing a list or strings into an array, which we can apply all the array methods on them</p>
<p>For instance, we can combine few arrays into a single array, due to using spread operator, which split an array into its individual items</p>
