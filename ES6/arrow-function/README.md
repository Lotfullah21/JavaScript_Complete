<h2>Arrow Function(Fat arrow [=>])</h2>
<p>
Here, we can use arrow functions instead of tradation one where,we have name, body
(), {}, and so, we can ommit these elements in certain cases in arrow functions
but arrow functions also has their own limitation, for instance, it cannot be used as constructors, methods,
and also cannot use yield inside its body</p>
<p>`Arrow function do not have names, if we want to access them later, we need to bind them to a variable`;</p>
<p>`if there is a single line, single return statement, we can omit {},()`;</p>
<h5>Key Features</h5>

<li>assign them to a variable</li>
</ol>
