<h2>Modules</h2>
<p>modules are a way to organize and encapsulate code. They allow you to split your code into separate files, making it more manageable, maintainable, and reusable</p>
<h4>Exporting</h4>
<p>You can export variables, functions, classes, or objects from a module using the export keyword. There are two main ways to export:</p>

<ol>
<li>Named export: where we can export as many functions or data ... as we want</li>
<li>Default export: where we can export only once, this one can be the main functionality or usage of our module</li>
<li></li>
</ol>

<code><script type="module" src="main.js"></script></code> add type = module script.

<h4>Importing from modules</h4>
<p>we can use import statement to get the modules from exported modules and use {} for named exports where the names should match and for default export we have the freedom of what ever name we choose, but the paths should be correct.</p>
