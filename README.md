# JavaScript Learning Repository

Welcome to the **JavaScript Learning Repository**! This project contains various exercises, examples, and projects that cover fundamental and advanced JavaScript concepts.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

The repository is organized into multiple directories and files, each focusing on different aspects of JavaScript development. Below is a brief description of the structure:

- **0-console/**: Basic examples and exercises demonstrating console output and debugging.

- **01-basics/**: This folder covers the basics of JavaScript such as syntax, variables, and data types.

- **06-functions/**: Focused on functions, their creation, and various use cases in JavaScript.

- **07-conditionals/**: Conditional statements such as `if-else`, `switch`, and how they are used in decision-making.

- **08-Loops/**: Detailed lessons on looping structures such as `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops.

- **09-strings/**: Manipulation of strings in JavaScript, covering methods and operations.

- **10-array/**: Covers arrays, array methods, and how to work with arrays in JavaScript.

- **11-scope/**: Introduction to scoping rules in JavaScript (function scope, block scope, etc.).

- **12-DOMs/**: Introduction to the Document Object Model (DOM) and how to interact with it using JavaScript.

- **14-DOM-Projects/**: Contains practical projects related to DOM manipulation.

- **15-objects/**: Focuses on working with objects in JavaScript, covering properties, methods, and prototypes.

- **16-functions-advanced/**: Explores advanced function concepts like closures, callbacks, and higher-order functions.

- **17-ES6/**: Covers modern JavaScript features from ECMAScript 6 (ES6), such as arrow functions, destructuring, template literals, etc.
