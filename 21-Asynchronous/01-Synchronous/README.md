<h2>Synchronous</h2>
<p>javascript is a single threaded synchronous language</p>
<ol>
<li>Single-Threaded: It means the language operates using a single thread and that means it has only one execution context which means 
javascript executes one operation at a time.</li>
<li>Synchronous: It means each operation (functions, loops, I/O operation) is executed one after another in the synchronous manner.
For each operation to start, the previous operation had to be finished, if there  is a function the next line will wait until the function's execution is finished.</li>
</ol>
