## Rest operator (...)

- using rest operator,we collect all elements into a single array or object
- rest operator must be the last one, otherwise ERROR

both of the operators(rest,spread) will put the elements into an array of numbers or strings if numbers or strings are there
Use rest operator for function parameters and spread operator for function arguments
