<h3>API</h3>
<p>. It is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate and interact with each other</p>
<p>. APIs define the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information.</p>
<P>an API is A Uniform Resource Locator (URL) where we can retrieve data</P>
<p>specific url addresses that returns specific dataf</p>

<h4>throw</h4>
<p>it throws a used defined exception,where execution of the current function will stop and which means the statement after throw won't be executed and control will be passed to the first catch block</p>

<p>async function always returns a promise, to use that promise(returned value),either we have use .then() or await method
Reference to: app.js line 52.

<p>in the 'index.html' page we are adding article and the image inside the <a> so that we can navigate to the reference page to see more information</p>

<p>when adding width or max-width to a section, if you want to put it in the center please add <code>margin:o auto</code></p>

<h3>WHAT I LEARNED FROM THIS PROJECT</h3>
<ol>

<li><strong>HTML</strong>: put the element insde an <a> so that you can go to a new page by clicking on the element inside <a></li>
<hr>
<li>use section just to add some padding around</li>
<li><strong>CSS</strong>: always when adding a fixed width to an element,add <code>margin:0 auto</code> </li>
<li>add a max-width to the section</li>
<li>for the form input, add a fixed width so that you can see the whole place holder</li>
<li>add border to the image, it will look, but same as the container one</li>
<li>in a secion, if you add <code>display:grid</code>, here for example the <a> counts as a grid element, to add distance betwwen their columns or rows, you can add that property inside the section and that will be counted as the distance between the grid elements, not the section itself.</li>
<li>adding position absolute to the cocktail h3 was a new learning experience</li>
</ol>
