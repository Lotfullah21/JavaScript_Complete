## Loop

Using loops, we can repeatedly execute a block of code while the condition is true.
in javascript, there are three different ways to create loops.

</h3><a href="./01-for">For loop</a></h3>
</h3><a href="./02-while">While loop</a></h3>
</h3><a href="./03-doWhile">do while loop</a></h3>

## Note:

Do not use `const` keyword as a inc/dec variable inside with the loops.
