## new Date()

it is a global object which can be used anywhere in our project.
The output of this object will be indices rather than full names of the months or the days, hence we use an additional array of names to have a readable output.

for instance Saturday and January have the indices of 0 when applying the `getMonth()` and `getDay()` method.
