There are seven data types in javascript

1. String
2. Number
3. Boolean
4. Null
5. Undefined
6. BigInt
7. Symbol

Each piece of information has a different value and all values are called data.
But values are different and needs to be stored differently.

## String

Text values are known as string data type.

## Number

Numerical value are referred as number data type.

It is one of the foundational data types that can represent integer and decimal values.

## Boolean

It has two values, true and false. better for making decisions.

## Null

The null value represents the intentional absence of any object value.

## Undefined

A variable that has been declared but not assigned a value is of type undefined.

## BigInt

BigInt is used for numbers that are too large to be represented by the Number data type.

```js
let a = 3290n;
```

the n suffix in 3290n denotes a BigInt literal. The BigInt type is used for representing and working with large integers that are beyond the range of the standard Number type.

## Symbol

A Symbol is a unique and immutable primitive value and may be used as the key of an Object property.
