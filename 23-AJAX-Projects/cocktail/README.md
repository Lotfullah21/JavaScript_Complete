### throw Error

it throws a used defined exception,where execution of the current function will stop and which means the statement after throw won't be executed and control will be passed to the first catch block

in the 'index.html' page we are adding article and the image inside the <a> so that we can navigate to the reference page to see more information

When adding width or max-width to a section, if you want to put it in the center please add <code>margin:o auto</code>

### WHAT I LEARNED FROM THIS PROJECT

## HTML

<hr>

- use section just to add some padding around
- <strong>CSS</strong>: always when adding a fixed width to an element,add <code>margin:0 auto</code>
- add a max-width to the section
- for the form input, add a fixed width so that you can see the whole place holder
- add border to the image, it will look, but same as the container one
- in a section, if you add

  ```css
  section {
  	display: grid;
  }
  ```

here for example the <a> counts as a grid element, to add distance between their columns or rows, you can add that property inside the section and that will be counted as the distance between the grid elements, not the section itself.

- adding position absolute to the cocktail h3 was a new learning experience.
