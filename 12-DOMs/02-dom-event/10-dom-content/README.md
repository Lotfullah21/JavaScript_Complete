## DOMContentLoaded

it fires when the initial html document has been completely loaded and parsed without waiting for images and other media

### setTimeout

runs a function once for a specific duration

### setInterval

it works the same, but it executes the reference function repeatedly after the given interval.

setTimeout function returns a unique identifier

```js
setTimeout(reference-function, timer)
setTimeout(hello, 2000)

```
