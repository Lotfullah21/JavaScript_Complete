<h2>Class</h2>
<p>In JavaScript, a class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects. It defines the properties and methods that the objects created from it will have. JavaScript classes were introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) to provide a more structured and object-oriented approach to programming in JavaScript.</p>
<p><em>the whole point of having a class is getting a cleaner code instead of going for seperate constructor, seperate protoype.(ALL IN ONE PLACE)</em></p>
