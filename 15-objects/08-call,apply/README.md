## call

using call method,we can define a function and apply that function on every object.

#### parameters:

`first parameter`: the object(the object we are going to apply the function to).
`second-parameter`: arguments to the function.

## apply

same as call method, the only difference, here we pass the arguments as an array

## bind

same as call method, but it does not run instantly, we can assign to a variable and invoke it later
