<h3>JavaScript</h3>
<p>javascript is a single threaded synchronous language</p>
<ol>
<li>Single-Threaded: it means the language operates using a single thread, which means it has only one execution context.
javascript executes one operation at a time. </li>
<li>Synchronouse: this means each operation(functinos, loops, I/O operation) is executed one after another in the synchronouse manner.
for each operation to start the previous operation had to be finished, if there  is a function, the next line will wait until the function execution is finished.</li>
</ol>
